# Chatbot
Rule based and Self learning smart Chatbot

In this project, we have designed a neural network-based AI chatbot that uses LSTM as its training model for both
encoding and decoding.

The model was trained end-to-end without any handcrafted rules. The huge conversational dataset used for training the
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is the Cornell Movies dataset. The chatbot self learns from
the training data and answers questions that are not domain specific.
